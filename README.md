# Sintract 
## Overview
Sintract aims to provide a Postman-like experience for interacting with deployed smart contracts. Enabling developers to interact with their smart contracts without any hurdles, avoiding writing cumbersome command line interfaces, complex verifications, wasting hours writing their own interaction interfaces, etc.

## Product Description
Sintract will have the following features:

- Multi Tab support, developers can save multiple smart contracts info, to interact with.
- Utility menu for data conversions such as decimals to uint, string to bytes, etc. So that thereâ€™s no need to leave the platform to perform these conversions.
- Advanced UX for complex input types like tuples and arrays.
- Support and guides for how to interact with custom networks, anvil or hardhat-network
- Watch/subscribe smart contract events
- Additionally, we will also add a share feature, so that devs can share custom links to their contracts interface. It will also include the info whether the smart contract has been verified or not

We have a beta version for our application [here](https://www.sintract.io/).

## Ecosystem Fit
Overall, Sintract will provide a much-needed solution to improve the developer experience in the smart contract development space, and we believe it has the potential to be a game-changer for the industry.
